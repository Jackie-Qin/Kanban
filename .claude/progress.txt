# Kanban Progress

## Last Session: Initial harness setup (2026-02-14)

### What's Done
- All 8 architecture roadmap items completed (SQLite, handler split, versioning, event bus, ripgrep, error boundaries, tests, targeted persistence)
- Version 1.2.0 released on GitHub
- App is stable and in daily use

### Current State
- No active feature work
- All tests passing (28 tests)
- Clean main branch

### What's Next
- Awaiting new feature requests
- Potential areas: performance optimization, new panel types, cloud sync, mobile companion

### Known Issues
- Git panel polls every 3s (`.git` watcher only catches index/ref changes, not working tree edits)
- Files >5MB rejected from Monaco Editor (intentional guard)
- No auto-update — users manually download from GitHub releases

### Architecture Notes
- Terminal PTY processes persist across project switches (CSS visibility toggle)
- Git `status.files` is the only reliable source — never use convenience arrays
- Git branch listing must NOT fetch (no network dependency)
- fetchData uses generation counter to prevent stale polling overwrites
